# Hackathon-Language-ID-Challenge-Exam
Introduction
Welcome to the Language Identification Challenge Hackathon! In this challenge, we aim to build a robust language identification model that can accurately classify text into its respective language category. This notebook serves as a comprehensive guide to our approach, methodology, and the steps taken to create an effective language identification solution.

Challenge Overview
Language identification is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) and has numerous applications, ranging from content filtering to improving machine translation systems. The goal of this hackathon is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a model that excels at accurately determining the language of a given text, even in cases of multilingual or ambiguous content.

Dataset
Our dataset comprises a diverse collection of text samples from various languages. Each text entry is labeled with its corresponding language, forming the basis for supervised learning. The challenge is to train a classification model that can generalize well to unseen text data.
